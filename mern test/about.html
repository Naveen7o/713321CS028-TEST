          <p>A booking website is an online platform where customers can reserve rooms, services, or accommodations in real-time. It typically features a user-friendly interface, allowing users to search and filter options based on various criteria such as location, dates, and amenities. Here are some key aspects of a booking website:

            Property Listings: A comprehensive directory of available properties, including hotels, bed and breakfasts, vacation rentals, hostels, and more.
            Availability Calendar: A visual representation of the booked status of each property, enabling users to easily check availability for their desired dates.
            Booking Engine: A secure and user-friendly system for processing reservations, including payment processing and confirmation notifications.
